You have an invoice ready for you. Normaly while ordering the service you should
have been directed to our Payment Gateway at the following URL from your
browser:

   {{ payment_url }}
 
If for some reason that process went wrong or if payment didn't go through for
some reasons, you can retry a new payment process for the service at:

  {{ invoice_url }}

Either ways, if the invoice is already paid, the system won't allow it to be
paid a second time and you'll receive a payment notice email (that might be
already waiting in your inbox)

Service: {{ info }}
