Before we get to using distutils/deb and co to automate the installation, here
is a quick and dirty way to get going with Webfinance front end.

Create a local_settings.py in this directory, your local_settings should contain
at least the databases configuration using the new multidb dict syntax (the old
syntax is ok but you'll get the deprecation warning and will need to fix it
sooner or later). It should look something like:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'webfinance',
        'USER': 'USER',
        #'PASSWORD': 'YOURSECRET',
        'HOST': 'IP OR HOSTNAME', 
        'PORT': '',
    }
}


If you're using mysql, then you'll need mysql python driver:

On Debian family:
   apt-get install python-mysqldb

On Mac OS X with py27 as the default port: 
   sudo port install py27-mysql

You'll then need to create the database:
  Get into this source directory and run:
  # python manage.py syncdb
